### Introduction

A single page website has been built to showcase a data dashboard that analyses 1,000 students exam performance in Math, Reading & Writing. 

The page uses the D3.js library with the DC.js and crossfilter.js libraries to present the data via a series of scatter plots, pie charts, bar charts and line charts. The graphical arrangement has been designed allow the user to quickly understand a summary of student performance and then backed up with interesting data analysis to reach meaningful hypothesis.
 
Intriguingly, the user can opt to adapt their view of student data by all, individual or custom data element selection via dropdown list function.
